  <h1>The Public Land Deer Hunts in Carlisle:<br>A Science-based Viewpoint</h1>
  </head>
  
   <img src="/images/carlisle_library.jpg"}> 
  <h2>
  A Brief History of the Carlisle Public Land Deer Hunts
  </h2>
  In 2018, the Carlisle Select Board initiated a pilot bow-hunt for deer on public lands. Their stated objective
  was protection of our forest under-story from damage due to an overabundance of deer. 10 deer (5 females)  were killed in this initial hunt.

  <p>In 2019, another hunt occurred, resulting in the killing of 6 deer (3 females).
  
  </p><p>In 2020, due to significant public opposition, the Select Board canceled the  2020 hunt and decided to place the 
  public land deer-hunting question before the 2021 Town Meeting. In the spring of 2021, the Select Board chose to join a Boston University
  research program that is studying how communities deal with deer issues. The question of whether to continue the town land hunts did not
  appear on the warrant for the 2021 Town Meeting.
  
  </p><p>The Select Board's concern for our forest under-story is attributable to an aggressive campaign by the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife (DFW) 
  to encourage towns to adopt deer-hunting programs. DFW is a state organization supported by revenues from hunting, trapping and fishing licenses. 
  This campaign was intended to alarm the targeted towns of the consequences of deer overabundance.

  </p><p>
 The Carlisle Select Board acted despite the absence of a rigorous and unbiased study demonstrating forest damage that could be attributed to deer overabundance.
 There was also much data and expert opinion that public-land archery hunts could not and would not address deer issues.
  </p>
  <h2>
  A Summary of the Argument Against the Hunts
  </h2>
  </p>Throughout human history, nature has surprised us. In the absence of scientific knowledge, we have made assumptions about the workings of our world that 
  seemed plausible, that suited our sense of order, and were completely wrong.  For example, for much of our history it was thought that the earth was the center of the universe. Copernicus taught us otherwise.
  Similarly, Galileo corrected the idea, which came from Aristotle, that in a vacuum, heavy objects dropped from a certain height will reach the ground before light objects dropped from the same height at the same time. There are many other examples of science correcting widely held but incorrect beliefs.

   </p><p>And so it is with deer. A great deal of scientific knowledge has been accumulated concerning both deer-related problems and their management. Consistent with our history, the intuitions of lay people are frequently contradicted by that science.
   It is therefore essential that we call upon actual scientific knowledge, rather than untested conjecture, both when establishing whether deer-related problems exist and if they do, what to do about them. It is the purpose of this website to assist with this goal.

   </p><p>A summary of this work appears below, without supporting detail. If you are prepared to accept what is said, you needn't read further than the summary.
   But for those who wish a more detailed understanding of how and why we have reached the conclusions described here, further reading will be necessary. The summary  contains many links to the explanatory material. <a href="#impossible">That material</a> may also be read from beginning to end, if you prefer.
 </p><p>
  <ul>
    <li>
   Whatever deer problems we may have in Carlisle (or think we have), it is <a href="#impossible">impossible to solve them with bow hunting on town land.</a>
   For the hunts to address those problems, they must reduce the size of the deer herd. To accomplish this, the town-land hunts would need to cause the total number of deer killed annually in Carlisle by humans (town land hunting, private land hunting, automobile collisions) to exceed the number of deer the herd
   would add annually by reproduction. We demonstrate by evidence and calculation that this is impossible, even if we expand the hunts as proposed by the Carlisle Deer Control Committee (DCC), because of the powerful ability of well-fed deer herds to reproduce.
    </li> <li>
  <p>
  Data provided by the Massachusetts Division of Fish and Wildlife (DFW), tells us that <a href="#HuntingFailure">all forms of hunting in Massachusetts</a> over almost six decades resulted
  in a 300% increase in the number of deer killed annually during that time period. Nonetheless, the Massachusetts deer herd continued to grow during that time.
 </p><p>
       Of great importance, most of the herd growth in those nearly six decades occurred in the eastern suburbs, <a href="#RapidGrowth"> at least in part because well-fed deer reproduce rapidly</a>,
       and in suburban eastern Massachusetts <a href="#feast">we have created an unnaturally hospitable environment for deer</a>. This pits the rate at which hunters can kill deer against the powerful ability of well-fed deer herds to grow. Six decades of data demonstrate that the hunters have failed.
 </p><p>
       It should also be noted that the hospitable suburban environment makes greater herd sizes possible than would be the case in a natural setting, and it is more difficult to reduce a larger deer herd to a desired size in a given time period than a smaller one.
 </p><p>
 Also contributing to the difficulty of controlling deer herds in the eastern suburbs is the necessity of laws that restrict hunting in densely populated areas.

      by the Carlisle Lyme Disease Subcommittee, and by the same calculation used to demonstrate that bow-hunting on town land in Carlisle cannot solve deer problems.

    </li> <li>
      The town land bow hunts have costs:

  </ul>

   <h2 id="impossible">Bow-hunting of deer on public land in Carlisle cannot solve deer problems</h2>
   Despite the fact that we do not know how many deer there are in Carlisle, some people believe there are too many.  

 </p><p>
   How many is "too many" is a complex question, involving human perceptions and priorities in addition to environmental issues.
   Much can be found in the deer-science literature about this. For example:
      <blockquote>
        Whitetail abundance is relative. Where the species exists and poses a threat to human priority, those deer -- at whatever density -- will be considered
        overabundant and a problem. The problem becomes conflict not so much by adjustment of the deer numbers but by changing or competing human priorities.
        We know of few places, except for artificial enclosures -- physical or political -- where whitetails are overabundant in a biological, carrying capacity sense.
        On the other hand, we are well aware that deer numbers approach or exceed human tolerance levels in many areas. And just as humans define overabundance, so too do
        humans proscribe biodiversity; it is what suits us most conveniently and conventionally at the time. <i>Homo sapiens</i> may or may not be the most intelligent
        life form on this planet, but it is certainly the most sanctimonious and doubtlessly the most environmentally disruptive.  -- "Recounting Whitetails Past" by T. R. and R. E. McCabe,
       the first chapter in the book <i>The Science of Overabundance, Deer Ecology and Population Management</i>, a collection of writings on deer overabundance published by The Smithsonian Institute.
      </blockquote>
 </p><p> While the scolding the McCabes direct at all of us may be unpleasant, it is important to understand the distinction they make between the environmental and societal limits on deer numbers; they are different, with the former
 almost always greater than the latter.  It is more likely that people <i>think</i> there are too many deer, because of eaten hostas or concerns about Lyme Disease, than it is that the herd size is actually large enough to cause serious environmental damage.
</p><p id="RapidGrowth">
People who believe there are too many deer in Carlisle tend to favor the deer hunts in the hope that the hunts will reduce the size of the deer herd and therefore solve the problems that concern them.
That this is a false hope begins with a simple and indisputable fact: deer herds with sufficient food grow rapidly.
</p><p>
How rapidly?
<blockquote>
  "Two strong and well-nourished deer can produce as many as 30 offspring in a seven-year period." -- http://bioweb.uwlax.edu. This is equivalent to a maximum growth rate of 48.6%<a href="#F1">[1]</a> (the number enclosed in square
  brackets is a clickable link to a footnote, which you find throughout this site).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"Because deer have a high reproductive potential and few natural predators,
deer populations have the potential to increase rapidly.  In the absence of significant mortality, deer populations can double in size in two years." -- The State of Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP). Doubling in
two years is equivalent to an annual growth rate of 41.4%.
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
      "Deer populations in general have a remarkable ability to grow due to their high reproductive potential.
         In the fenced George Reserve in Michigan, a population of six deer grew to 222 deer in seven years (McCullough 1979, McCullough 1984)." -- Indiana Division of Fish and Wildlife. This represents a remarkable 67.5% annual growth rate, but in a fenced area. So while such a growth rate is likely not applicable to deer running free in a town like Carlisle, it is an instructive data point regarding the ability of deer herds to grow.
         </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
       A paper from the Texas A&M Agrilife Extension -- <i>Managing Overabundant White-tailed Deer</i>
           by James C. Cathey, Shawn L. Locke, Clark E. Adams, Sara Ramirez, Jessica Alderson, and Kevin Schwausch gives annual herd-size increases of just over 50%.
         </blockquote>
         <blockquote id="HaleMcCarthy">
         <a href="https://www.maa.org/book/export/html/115875">"Introduction to Population Ecology" -- Brandon M. Hale and Maeve L. McCarthy</a>, cites 3-year doubling times, equivalent to a growth rate of 26% annually.
         </blockquote>
</p><p>
These growth rates are typical of what we find in the deer literature. The conclusion is inescapable: well-fed deer herds grow rapidly without significant predation or deaths caused by humans.
</p><p>

To get a sense of the magnitude of the growth rates cited above, it is helpful to note that deer population growth and the growth of bank accounts paying compound interest are identical (exponential) processes mathematically. For a bank account to grow as
deer herds can – double in two years (using the estimate from Connecticut DEEP above) in the absence of significant withdrawals – would require an annual interest rate of 41.4%. 
 I doubt that there is anyone reading this (or any investment manager) who wouldn't be
thrilled with a long-term annual 41.4% return from their bank account or investment portfolio.
</p><p>
The greatest investors, whether Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch, or the late David Swensen (of the Yale Endowment Fund), have not come close to returning 41.4% annually over the long term. For example, in one of the most remarkable investing performances in history,  Peter Lynch managed the Fidelity Magellan fund from 1977 until 1990, achieving a 29% annual return (Mr. Lynch did best the growth rate cited in the Hale/McCarthy paper by a few percentage points).

</p><p id="HuntingFailure">
In order to reduce the size of the deer herd by hunting, we need to kill deer at a rate greater than the herd's natural growth rate.
That this is extremely difficult can first be seen from data provided by the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife (DFW).
The number of deer killed annually by hunters from 1961
through 2018 increased by a factor of 4, or 300% (see the chart below).
</p><p>
   <img src="/images/dfw_hunting_data.png"}> 
</p><p>
But since 1965, the number of hunters in Massachusetts has decreased by 50%.

</p><p>
The difficulty of hunting varies inversely with deer density (the number of deer per unit area, such as a square mile), meaning that the greater the density, the easier hunting becomes and vice-versa. The large <i>increase</i> in deer killed by Massachusetts hunters despite the large <i>decrease</i> in number of hunters is due to an increase in deer density, making hunting easier for the reduced number of hunters. Increased density in a constant area (the area of Massachusetts) means the deer population has increased. 

 </p><p>We see that despite the killing, the herd continued to grow over almost six decades. And, crucially, we know that most of that increase occurred in suburban eastern Massachusetts.
</p><p>This result is undoubtedly surprising to many. Part of the reason for this outcome is that state and local laws restrict hunting in densely populated areas,
for obvious and necessary safety reasons.
</p><p id="ConveyorBelt">
But another major factor contributing to this result is that in suburbs such as Carlisle, we have created a very hospitable environment for deer,
supplying them with large quantities of food by using plants in our residential landscapes that deer favor.
This issue is discussed in this <a href="#HumaneSociety">Humane Society of the United States</a> pamphlet and by Dr. Allen Rutberg of Tufts University in his <a href="#RutbergTalk">Carlisle talk</a>. 
</p><p>
Making matters worse, when the plants are eaten, we replace them.
One deer population researcher referred to this as "a deer food conveyor belt".
</p><p>
An additional problem is the feeding of deer, in well-intentioned but unwise attempts
to help the animals.

</p><p>
The rules of logic tell us that the inverse of "deer herds with sufficient food grow rapidly" is also true: deer herds
without sufficient food do not grow. The amount of available food imposes a limit on the herd size.
The ongoing deer-food feast that we are providing has increased that limit. It is more difficult to reduce larger herds to a desired size than is the case with smaller herds and the difficulty grows somewhat faster than linearly (doubling
the initial herd size requires killing more than twice the number of deer to achieve the same objective in the same time). 
</p><p>
The following conclusions are inescapable:
<ul>
<li>
  Availability of food limits the size of deer herds.
</li>  <li>
   Well-fed deer herds grow rapidly.
</li> 
<li>  
    In suburbia, <i>we</i> are feeding the deer, making larger herds possible than would occur in natural settings. 
    </li>
<li>  
    Larger herds are more difficult to reduce to a target size than smaller herds.
    </li>
    </ul>
    
    This, plus sensible safety laws and bylaws regarding discharge of weapons near residences, is why all forms of hunting in Massachusetts 
have failed to reduce the size of the State's herd. The herds are in rapid-growth mode thanks to the food we provide and hunters simply can't kill deer fast enough to overcome that growth. 

</p><p id="RutbergTalk">

This is precisely why an authority on deer population management, <a href="https://vetprofiles.tufts.edu/profile/allen-t-rutberg/">Dr. Allen Rutberg of Tufts University</a>, concluded the first half of his talk in Carlisle, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SonGERqBhw">a video of which will be found here</a>, with 
the statement
      <blockquote>
        Bow-hunting will not address serious deer problems. Archery hunts on suburban conservation lands are primarily recreational.
      </blockquote>
      
<p>Dr. Rutberg contributed a chapter to the same Smithsonian Institution book cited above.
<a href="pdfs/Rutberg_chapter_final.pdf">His contribution may be found here.</a>
    </p>
    An important quote from this chapter:
    <p>
      <blockquote>
            The most visible weakness in the assertion that hunting is necessary to control deer populations is that it has largely failed to do so… Just 
    because deer are being killed doesn't mean that deer populations are being controlled.
  </blockquote>
    </p>

    His point is another way of stating our primary thesis: if you don't kill deer faster than the herds  grow naturally -- and they do so rapidly when they have enough food --  you will not reduce herd sizes and consequently you will not solve problems related to deer overpopulation.

    <h3 id="calculation">A Carlisle-specific calculation</h3>

    Before proceeding, it is necessary to understand the characteristics
    of deer-herd growth. When there is enough food, the herd grows exponentially at some rate, which includes the effects of both reproduction and natural deaths. The herd does not grow indefinitely, however. At some point, it becomes
    large enough so that there is insufficient food to support further growth.
    
  </p><p>
  Let us assume that despite the evidence and expert opinion cited above, we decide to attempt a hunting program
  with the goal of reducing the deer herd size. What are our prospects for success?
    </p><p>
    There are two cases to consider: either the deer herd size is not limited by the available food or it is.
    <h4 id="growing">Case 1: The deer herd size is not limited by food availability</h4>
    In this case, the deer are well fed and the herd grows rapidly. In the calculations that follow we will use both
    the 26% and 41.4% growth rates <a href="#RapidGrowth">discussed previously</a>.
    </p><p>
         Such strong growth rates should give us pause about the feasibility of our hunting program. For this reason, we would like to calculate how many
    deer must be killed each year in our hunts, in addition to other ways deer are killed (automobile collisions, private and Federal land hunts), in order to reduce the herd size to a recommended level in a reasonable period of time.
    </p><p>
    To do so, we are fortunate that the mathematics that describes deer herd growth is the same
    as that of many exponential processes, among them the behavior of financial accounts paying compound interest.
    There are excellent tools available
    for solving compound interest problems, such as the financial functions in Excel or Google Sheets. 
    The gold standard for performing such calculations is the classic HP12c business calculator. Because the math is the same, we can use those tools to perform our deer-hunt calculation. 
    </p><p>
    Within the limits of practicality, I will accompany the results I obtain
    with a footnote link (an integer in square brackets, e.g. [3]) specifying the HP12c setup required to obtain the result I am discussing. This will allow you to replicate my results if you have a 12c or a phone-based 12c emulator. I do assume
    that you are familiar with the HP12c and understand how to solve cash-flow problems with this superb tool. If you need a refresher and don't have your printed manuals, you will find <a href="pdfs/HP12c_User_Guide.pdf">the HP12c User Guide in .pdf format here,</a> 
    </p><p>
    The problem we wish to solve is this: given an initial herd size and the herd's growth rate,
    we would like to calculate many deer must be killed in town land bow hunts annually (in addition to the other ways deer are killed in Carlisle -- private land and Great Meadows hunting and automobile collisions)
    to reach a specified reduced herd-size in a certain number of years. 
    This is identical mathematically to being given an initial bank balance and an interest rate, and being asked to calculate how
    much can be withdrawn from the account annually so that we have a certain reduced balance after a certain number of years.
    </p><p>
    While the actual number of deer in Carlisle is unknown, we have estimates from DFW. Jonathan DeKock, the former chair of the Deer Control Committee, reported
    in his paper <i>"Quantifying Deer in Carlisle"</i> that David Stainbrook, formerly of DFW, and the principal motivator of Carlisle's and other towns' deer-hunting programs, estimated that there are between 30 and 60 deer per square
    mile in Carlisle. Mr. Stainbrook also provided an estimate that there are 11.4 square miles of deer-habitable land in Carlisle (deducting uninhabitable areas, such as ponds, from Carlisle's total area of 15.5 square miles).
    Multiplying the estimated densities by 11.4 square miles results in population estimates of 342 to 684 deer in Carlisle. In our subsequent discussion, we will use the average of Mr. Stainbrook's estimates, 513. Mr. DeKock further reported that Mr. Stainbrook
    believed that the appropriate number of deer in Carlisle is 200.
    </p><p>
    We now have a specific problem to solve, and that is to calculate the number of deer that must be killed in the town land hunts in order
    to reduce the herd from 513 to 200 in some number of years. Solving this problem requires a growth rate. We will solve the problem twice, once using the <a href="#HaleMcCarthy">Hale/McCarthy</a> 26% growth rate and again using the Connecticut DEEP growth rate, 41.4%.
      </p><p>
      Before proceeding, we must address one further complication: when the hunted deer are killed with respect to when deer reproduce. 
      </p><p>
      If we assume that all deer are killed each year before reproduction begins, the compounding effect is reduced (similar to assuming that we make all withdrawals from a bank account each year <i>before</i> annual interest is paid). Herd growth will be slower and the required kill rates to reach the target population will be smaller. 
      </p><p>
      If we assume the opposite -- all deer are killed
      after reproduction -- we obtain the full compounding effect: fast herd growth and larger required kill rates.
      </p><p>
      Because the deer "rut", the reproduction season, is from November 6 to November 20 in Massachusetts, it is reasonable to use the average of the two extremes, because the "rut" is almost perfectly centered in the October through December deer-hunting season. 
      This has been done in the calculations we are about to discuss.
      </p><p>
      
      To obtain the required town land kills to reach the target population of 200 deer, the 31 deer killed annually in private-land and Great Meadows hunts and the 25 <a href="#F2">[2]</a> killed in automobile collisions are deducted from the total required kill.
      </p><p>

      Our results are summarized in the following bar chart. The chart provides the results of our calculations of the number of deer that would need to be killed in the town land hunts to reach DFW's target population of 200 in  2, 5, 10, and 30 years, starting with a herd size of 513 and using the 26% and 41.4% annual growth rates previously discussed. The estimated (by the Carlisle Deer Control Committee (DCC) former chairman, Johnathan DeKock) kill (24) for expanded town land hunts and the average (8) of the actual results of the pilot hunts are included for reference.
      </p><p>
      <img src="/images/Required_kill_bar_chart.png"}>
      </p><p id="BarChartResults">
      Focusing on the group of bars for the 5 year time frame, we see that the calculation indicates that if the growth rate is 41.4%, 150<a href="#F3">[3]</a> deer would have to be killed annually in the town land hunts to reach the 200-deer target in 5 years. A growth
      rate of 26% would require that 98 deer be killed annually in the town land hunts to reach the 200-deer target in that 5-year time frame. These are factors of 6.25 (525%) and 4.08 (308%) greater than 24-deer/year best-case estimate by the Carlisle DCC for the expanded town land hunts. Giving ourselves 10 years to accomplish the task, 129  and 72 deer/year are factors of 5.37 (437%) and 3 (200%) larger than the expanded-hunt estimate. Taking 30 years to accomplish the task would still require factors of 5.25 (425%) and 2.67 (167%) more deer killed in the town land hunts than the estimates the DCC estimates expanded hunts could yield.
      </p><p>
      If bringing the herd size down to the DFW target is not possible, we could calculate how many deer we would need to kill in the town land hunts
            to try to accomplish a less ambitious goal, that of simply stopping herd growth. Doing so, the result is 126, using a growth rate of 41.4%. With a growth rate of
                  26%, the result is 64. Both are still well out of the reach of the town land hunts<a href="#F4">[4]</a>.
      </p><p>
      
    </p><p>
      It should be clear at this point that regardless of what assumptions are made about initial herd size, growth rates,  killing vs. reproduction relationships, or time frames we allow ourselves, the annual town land kills required to reach the DFW target of 200 are well beyond the most favorable estimate for expanded town land hunts. This is completely consistent with DFW's own hunting data over 57 years showing even greatly increased hunting's inability to control the state-wide deer population and with Dr. Rutberg pointedly telling us that town land bow-hunts would not solve deer-related problems. 
    </p><p>

     <h4>Case 2: The deer herd size is limited by food availability</h4>
     
     If the Carlisle deer herd has reached the point where the available food does not permit further growth, either that herd size presents a problem or it doesn't. If the herd size is not a problem, then we
     don't need the town land hunts. So let's assume that the herd size  does present a problem.  What happens if we initiate town land hunts in this situation, hoping to reduce the herd size? 
     </p><p>
   
     The answer is that we kill some deer,
      which initially reduces the herd size by approximately the number we kill. But by reducing the herd size, the herd is no longer limited by food availability and is again in rapid growth mode (sometimes even more rapid than before; this is the
      "rebound effect", well known to deer management scientists), <a href="#growing">as described earlier</a>. The result is that the herd grows back to the size limited by food availability, unchecked by the town land hunts because of the arguments presented in <a href="#growing">Case 1</a>. Our problem remains unsolved and our attempts to reduce the herd size by bow-hunting on town land are again futile. 
     </p><p>

     <h4 id="females">Would focusing on killing females work?</h4>
   It is well known that hunting as a deer population control measure is thought to have a better chance of success if hunters concentrate on killing females. 
   The hope is that reducing the number of females reduces the herd's capacity to reproduce.
   Killing males doesn't matter much, because the surviving males will take up the slack, mating with more females. Also males wander, so
   if the supply of males becomes low, males from considerable distances are available to replace them.

     </p><p>
     There are problems with this approach:

     <ul>
    <li>
       In one of nature's many surprises, deer herds are known to respond to culls with an increased number of multiple births, thus negating, in whole or in part, the change in the sex ratio of the herd.
    </li>
    <li>
   As discussed above, females, unlike males, do not wander. They tend to stay close to where their food source is, which in suburbia is frequently our residences.  State law and Carlisle town bylaw
   prohibit hunting on or in the vicinity of residential property without the permission of the owner. This is a significant obstacle to increasing the bias toward killing females.
    </li>
    <li>
   As the density of all deer is reduced, hunting them becomes exponentially more difficult, as can be seen in this chart:
     </p><p>
   <img src="/images/hunting_efficiency.png"}> 
     </p><p>
   </li>
    <li>
      Some, perhaps most, hunters prefer killing males, in order to obtain a trophy.
    </li>
  </ul>

   Because those in favor of deer hunts encourage a bias toward killing females, we have done another calculation,
using small program I wrote, because studying the effectiveness of this idea  is beyond the capabilities of an HP12c or spreadsheet financial functions.
 <a href="#growing">Unlike the work described earlier</a>, which assumed equal numbers of females and males killed and thus a constant reproduction rate, this calculation assumes an emphasis on killing females,
   incrementally modifying the herd's growth rate as the sex ratio of the herd changes as result of that bias. As before, we also account for the difference between
   assuming that all deer are killed before versus after reproduction. 

     </p><p>
   This calculation does not attempt to model the obstacles to hunting females discussed above and therefore is likely to be conservative -- the kill requirement may be too low. 
   </p><p>
    In this calculation, we assume that 67% of the deer killed are female. Why 67%? Martha's Vineyard has a very active program of deer hunting, in a misguided attempt to control Lyme Disease risk. Richard Johnson, the biologist who heads the island-wide tick-borne illness reduction program was quoted in an article in the Vineyard Gazette on September 19, 2019:
    <blockquote>
    In 2016, the first year incentives began on the Island to encourage more deer harvest, the number rose to 764. In 2017 there were 844 deer taken. Last year the number was 900.

"The trend is upward," Mr. Johnson said. He said an ideal goal would be to take 600 female deer annually.

"If we hit that number I'd be really pleased," he said.
</blockquote>
Mr. Johnson is here setting an "ideal goal", as yet unachieved, of killing 600 female deer annually at a time when 900 deer were killed in total and "the trend is upward". Thus, his goal is that 67% of the deer killed in their hunts be female. It is worth noting that in both the 2018 and 2019 pilot deer hunts in Carlisle, 50% of the deer killed were female.
     </p><p>
   The results obtained from our calculation are that it would be necessary to kill 121 deer in the town land hunts to reduce the herd from 513
   to 200 in 5 years assuming an initial growth rate of 41.4%, a factor of 5 (400%) greater than the best estimate for expanded town land hunts. If we assume a growth rate of 26%, it would be necessary to kill 81 deer/year in the town land hunts to reduce the herd from 513 to 200, a factor of 3.37 (227%) greater than estimated expanded town land hunt results. These requirements are about 19% and 16.5% smaller than if we assume an equal number of females and males are killed in those hunts, but are both still well beyond the reach of the expanded
   hunts.
   </p><p>

     <h3>Summary</h3>

     Hunting, especially in suburbia, has been not an effective tool for controlling deer populations in Massachusetts for many decades. 57 years of Massachusetts hunting and deer population data attest to that, as do experts such as
     Dr. Rutberg. Our Carlisle-specific calculations, done conservatively to avoid bias, produce results that are consistent with the data and expert opinions.

     </p><p>
  It is not good engineering practice to attempt to solve problems we aren't reasonably sure we have. Nor should we adopt an approach to problems (if they exist) that data, experts and mathematics tell us will not work. Our engineering becomes even worse if we fail to employ metrics (a glaring omission in the 2018 and 2019 pilot program) that would tell us whether our approach is working.
    </p><p>
  
    Adopting a "feel-good" but demonstrably erroneous and poorly engineered approach to problem-solving can have the effect of giving us a false sense of security  that we are accomplishing something we are not, especially when metrics aren't part of the program. This leads to failure to pursue approaches that will be effective. 
    </p><p>

  We have gotten a crash course in the past year concerning what happens when we ignore science, scientists and data. I am speaking, of course, about the COVID-19 virus. We should not commit the same error in our decision-making about deer issues.

    <h2 id="feast" >If bow-hunting won't work, what can we do?</h2>
As discussed previously, deer herds only grow rapidly when well fed. When their numbers reach the limits of the food supply, the herd stops growing.
But <u>we</u> are feeding them, with the plantings we choose for our residential landscapes. And when the deer eat those plants, we replace them. This practice, and that of some in town who feed deer in an unwise attempt to help the animals,
increases the natural limit on the herd size, the biological carrying capacity.
</p><p>
Put simply, <u>we</u> are unwittingly making larger deer populations possible with the hospitality we are providing in our yards and/or by feeding the animals.
</p><p>


If we establish that we have a legitimate concern about the size of the deer herd and damage the deer might cause, a town-wide program to educate and encourage residents 
to use deer-resistant plants in their landscapes and not to feed deer
 would make a significant contribution to a <u>real</u> solution to controlling the size of the deer herd. 
 This  makes a great deal more sense, by attacking a (perhaps <u>the</u>) root cause of the problem, than enabling deer herds to grow beyond naturally imposed limits
 and then hopelessly trying to control what we have done by attempting to kill the animals with bows and arrows, ignoring that nature has given deer a powerful defense, the ability to grow their herds rapidly.

    </p><p id="texas_recommendation">
The Texas A&M paper  (Cathey, Locke et al) cited earlier makes a similar assertion:

<blockquote>
The most common management actions required to get at the root cause are to foster an environment that does not encourage the overabundance of deer. The prohibition of feeding deer is critical to solving overabundance. Some communities have enacted feeding bans for many wildlife populations (to include raccoons, coyotes, foxes, etc), and some just for white-tailed deer. Enforcement of these feeding bans is just as critical. Additionally, encouraging residents to landscape with native, deer-resistant plants helps to alleviate resident complaints, slow financial losses resulting from damage, and restore native plant diversity. Reintroduction of predators is not feasible in urban areas, but naturally occurring urban predators, such as coyotes and bobcats, can help buffer exponential population growth, as long as human habituation by predators is not permitted.
</blockquote>
</p><p>
  There are additional measures we can take beyond being smarter about what we plant. 
  <h3>Contraception</h3>
  One of the most promising is contraception. This is the primary research area of Dr. Allen Rutberg of Tufts University, whose talk in Carlisle <a href="#RutbergTalk">is discussed here</a>.
  The method used by his group has been shown to work, reducing deer reproduction rates and herd sizes. While it is still in the experimental stage and there are regulatory hurdles that must be removed, 
  there is promise of turning this work into a practical method of deer control, deployable at reasonable cost. It would be sensible 
  and appropriate for the  Select Board to establish a formal relationship with him, positioning Carlisle to become part of his program if we definitively establish that we
  have problems caused by deer overabundance.

   <h2>Deer concerns </h2>
    <h3 id="ForestHealth">Forest health -- is there a problem?</h3>
    <p>
   
  An evaluation of our forest understories in 2016 by the Massachusetts
  Division of Fisheries and Wildlife (DFW) was a major factor in the Select Board's decision to
  initiate a town land bow-hunting program. DFW's funding comes from
  hunting and trapping licenses. It is a demonstrably pro-hunting organization, not unbiased. If they really
  cared about controlling deer populations, they would not advocate
  hunting coyotes, which they do, because coyotes are natural deer predators. 
  DFW is a classic follow-the-money situation.
  </p>
  <p>
  DFW's "study" in 2016 was done
  in three days by two people attempting an assessment of 3000 acres of forest. 
  Each person
  was therefore responsible for the evaluation of 500 acres per day, statistically very questionable.
  The work also violated DFW's own stated protocols by being conducted almost exclusively
  from trails. Most
  importantly, it failed to consider the context of the under-story conditions they did observe, 
  e.g., land use history and the age of the trees (new-growth and old-growth forests have
  very different natural understories). 
  </p>
  <p>
    The inadequacy of the DFW work means we do not know whether we have a forest-health problem
    due to deer overpopulation and it makes no sense to try to solve
    a problem we don't know we have.
  </p>
  <p>
  A rigorous study by qualified and unbiased people is needed to establish a baseline, 
  followed by periodic follow-on studies to obtain a trend. If mitigation measures prove to be necessary,
  the baseline plus follow-on studies would provide the metrics necessary to evaluate whether our chosen measures
  are actually solving the problem we've identified, if any. This is necessary standard good engineering practice that has
  not been done in the Carlisle town land hunting program thus far, with the exception of the work of Carlisle's Kay Hurley.
  </p> <p>
  Kay (under her former name, Kay Fairweather) is the author of ''Who's Who in the Natural World, Selections from a 10-year ramble through a corner of New England'', a beautiful book
  that you can obtain from the Gleason Library and from various booksellers.

  Under
  the auspices of the Carlisle Land Stewards sub-committee, Kay has undertaken a study of selected forest tracts in Carlisle, beginning with the Towle Land and the Davis Corridor.

She has written <a href="pdfs/Towle Observations-for-LSC.pdf">an initial report</a>  on her Towle findings.  It is very worthwhile reading.
  </p>

  <h3 id="LymeDisease">Lyme Disease</h3>
  Lyme Disease is a concern for us all. Especially if untreated, it can cause serious health problems, though fortunately it is rarely fatal.
  </p><p>
  Lyme Disease is an extremely complex problem:
  <blockquote>
    "For a very long time, people have been looking for that silver bullet or the magic answer to make Lyme disease go away. 
    We've known for a while now that's just not going to happen." -- Catherine Brown, Massachusetts public health veterinarian
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    Trying to fight Lyme is like "trying to solve a multivariate equation with 18 variables and only knowing two of them." -- Henry Lind, the co-chair of the Barnstable County Lyme/Tick-Borne Diseases Task Force.
  </blockquote>
  There is a view held by some that a reduction in deer density by a certain percentage will always result in the same percentage reduction in Lyme Disease risk. This assumes a causal linear relationship between deer density and Lyme Disease risk, which is false.
  Furthermore, much of the scientific community does not consider deer density a causal factor in Lyme Disease risk at all. Even a scientist in the minority, Dr. Samuel Telford of Tufts University, 
  who believes there is a causal link, writes that the causal relationship exists only when deer densities are brought to very low levels; otherwise, reduction of deer density has no effect on Lyme Disease risk. This is discussed further <a href="#Telford">below</a>.

  </p><p>
  Quotes from the work of scientists who have studied the problem:

  <blockquote>
      "There is insufficient evidence to recommend deer population reduction as a Lyme disease prevention measure, except in specific ecological circumstances." - Centers for Disease Control; July 15, 2015 ("specific ecological circumstances" refers to islands)
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
      A book on Lyme disease by leading Lyme disease expert, <a href="https://www.caryinstitute.org/science/our-scientists/dr-richard-s-ostfeld">Dr. Richard Ostfeld</a> of the Cary Institute, confirms that human risk of exposure to Lyme disease is correlated with the abundance of immature (rodent) hosts and their food resources, not deer numbers (Ostfeld et al, 2006, 2011).
  </blockquote>

  Quotes from Carlisle town committees:
  <blockquote>
      "Not a primary reason to manage the deer herd." -- Carlisle Deer Committee; February 2, 2018
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
      "Reduction in risk of Lyme Disease should not be considered the major rationale for the Carlisle deer hunt."  - Carlisle Lyme Disease Subcommittee; April 1, 2019
  </blockquote>

  </p><p>
  Dr. Ostfeld is a preeminent researcher on Lyme Disease and has written extensively on the subject. <a href="https://www.caryinstitute.org/news-insights/lecture-video/mice-ticks-using-ecology-prevent-lyme-disease">In this video</a>, Dr. Ostfeld
  is interviewed by Dr. Joshua Ginsberg, President of the Cary Institute. This interview contains a wealth of information about Lyme Disease and you don't need to be a scientist to understand it. Dr. Ostfeld's reasons for concluding that killing deer is
  not an effective approach to controlling <a href="https://www.mspca.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/lyme_disease_fact_sheet.pdf">Lyme Disease risk may be found here.</a>
  </p><p id="Telford">
  The scientific community is almost never unanimous on any question and Lyme Disease is no different. DFW has an ally in  Dr. Samuel Telford, a researcher at Tufts University, who, unlike Dr. Ostfeld and the CDC, thinks that there is a role for deer hunting in controlling Lyme Disease. He published a paper several years ago in the Journal of Integrated Pest Management, in which he says the following:
  <blockquote>
    The Bernards Township project (Jordan et al. 2007) halved deer density from an astonishing 45/km^2 to 24/km^2, with little effect on tick density, but the observed endpoint deer density is still an order of magnitude above what would be required to expect any reduction in Lyme disease risk, empirically estimated at 3-5/km^2. 
  </blockquote>
  This statement is interesting because an advocate of deer hunting to control Lyme Disease risk is conceding that above a certain deer density threshold of 3-5 deer/km^2 (7.77-12.95 deer/mi^2), killing deer will have little effect on Lyme Disease risk. In the interest of making our argument conservatively, we use the larger of Dr. Telford's threshold deer densities, 12.95 deer/mi^2.
  </p><p>
To convert Telford's threshold density to an actual target deer population for Carlisle, we need to multiply the density by area.  
  The area of Carlisle is 15.5 mi^2, but DFW estimates that the deer-habitable area of Carlisle is 11.4 mi^2. 
    11.4 mi^2 * 12.95 deer/mi^2 is about 148 deer. 
    We <a href="#calculation">earlier demonstrated</a> that it is impossible to reach a deer herd size of 200 from DFW's average estimate of 513 deer currently in Carlisle by allowing bow-hunting for deer on town land. 
    Obviously, lowering the target herd size does not improve the situation:
      </p><p>
      <img src="/images/Required_kill_Telford_bar_chart.png"}>
    Dr. Telford has provided information that allows us to calculate that the town land bow hunts will have no effect on Lyme Disease risk in Carlisle. 
  
    </p><p>
  The best approach to dealing with the risk of Lyme Disease is to follow the prevention recommendations of trusted health centers, such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lyme-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20374651F">The Mayo Clinic</a>.
  
  <h2 id="costs_without_benefits">Costs without benefits </h2>
<h3 id="safety"> People are afraid to use the trails during hunting season</h3>
     Many Carlisle residents have expressed concern about their inability to use the trails safely on the lands being hunted. This was a prominent theme in the comments offered by the public in the well-attended and very intense  Select Board meeting
     on June 9, 2020.

    </p><p>
     These fears are justified. Advocates of the hunts assert that bow-hunting is a safe activity, 
     quoting the statistic that no non-hunter has ever been killed by a bow-hunter in Massachusetts. 
     They ignore the fact that people will avoid using the trails when hunting is taking place. 
      Fewer people on the trails reduces the likelihood of an accident. People who avoid the trails during bow-hunts don't become accident victims!
      If very few people rode in cars, auto-accident fatality statistics would be excellent. The "safety" of bow-hunting is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
      </p><p>
     By forcing people to avoid our conservation land trails, the town land hunts in effect turn the hunted lands over to the hunters, most of whom are not Carlisle residents, for the duration of the deer season, 1/4 of the year. This is a gift to the hunters at the expense of Carlisle residents who
     overwhelmingly cite Carlisle's dedication to conservation and purchase of conservation lands as a primary reason they live in Carlisle and who have borne the cost of acquiring these lands and continue to do so.

     <h3 id="inhumane">Bow-hunting is inhumane</h3>
 The statistics provided to us about the 2018 and 2019 hunts do not tell us how many animals were wounded and managed to run off to die a slow death from infection and blood loss. A study of 80 radio-collared white-tailed deer found that of the 22 deer who had been shot with "traditional archery equipment", 11 were wounded but not recovered by hunters (Stephen S. Ditchkoff et al., "Wounding Rates of White-Tailed Deer With Traditional Archery Equipment", Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the Southeastern Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (1998)).
  </p><p>
I will refrain from including gruesome images of what bow-hunting really entails; be assured that they are horrifying. But I will include a quote from one of the Carlisle residents who signed our change.org petition opposing the town land hunts:

<blockquote>
"I helped remove a dead deer from a yard in Carlisle that died of a massive infection. The deer was found with an arrow in its hindquarters and was grotesquely swollen. The deer had obviously been suffering for an indeterminable amount of time. The deer hunt does nothing to stem Lyme disease. It is a clear danger to the Carlisle community with zero benefits."
</blockquote>
 
      <h3>"Doing something is always better than doing nothing"</h3>         
     There are those in 
  favor of the town land hunts who have contended that "doing something
is always better than doing nothing." Is it?
If you jump out of an airplane and your parachute fails to open,
is flapping your arms better than doing nothing? Is pouring a glass of water on a raging house fire better than doing nothing? Will killing 10 mosquitoes control the mosquito population in Carlisle?
  </p><p>
"Doing something" is not better 
if there is no benefit, or there is a benefit, it does not justify its added costs. 

  </p><p>
 Please consider this chart:

  </p><p>
   <img src="/images/with_without.png"}> 

  </p><p>
  Here it is assumed that the town land hunts are expanded per the Deer Control Committee proposal (double the hunters, increased area of town land hunted, the season extended from two to three months). The Deer Control Committee has estimated this would result in a factor of 2 or 3 more deer killed per year than occurred in the pilot hunts. We assume a factor of 3, 24 deer killed/year. We
  also assume that the maximum deer herd size (the biological carrying capacity) is 1000. As we did in <a href="#calculation">this section</a>, we use the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection estimate of the
  growth rate for well-fed deer herds and calculate herd sizes that are the average of first assuming all deer are killed before reproduction and then assuming the opposite. We also assume an initial herd size that is the average, 513,  of DFW's minimum and maximum estimates of 342 and 684.
  </p><p>
  The chart shows the growth of the deer herd both with and without the expanded town land hunts until it reaches its maximum size, imposed by the biological carrying capacity. As you can see from the blue curve, no deer problems are solved with the hunts, because despite the hunting, the herd
  continues to grow until the assumed biological carrying capacity is reached. Solving problems caused by too many deer requires a <i>reduction</i> in the herd size. All the hunts accomplish is to slightly slow the rate at which any deer-related problems we might have get worse. In year 3, the herd size reaches 1000 without the hunts, 976 with the hunts. The next year, the herd size is 1000 with or without the hunts. 
  </p><p>
  What has been "accomplished" with the hunts is hardly worth the loss of public access (<a href="#safety">due to legitimate safety concerns</a>) to an expanded set of town lands for an increased period of time -- three months extending from the end of the summer to early winter. It is also
  not worth the added monetary costs to the town to administer the hunts. And lastly, we must confront the moral cost of killing living creatures <a href="#inhumane">in brutal, inhumane fashion</a> without justification, given that their deaths do not solve deer problems. And a better approach exists, one that attacks the root cause of deer overpopulation -- correcting our use of deer-friendly plants in our residential landscapes and the unwise feeding of deer, <a href="#texas_recommendation">per the recommendation of the Texas A&M paper previously cited</a>.
  <h2>Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife (DFW)</h2>
The Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife, which I will refer to in the following as DFW, and particularly David Stainbrook, their former Program Manager for Moose and Deer, have been prime motivators
in the creation of bow-hunting programs in the eastern Massachusetts suburbs.
  </p><p>
  We have already discussed at some length why their advocacy of such a program for Carlisle makes no sense.
  </p><p>
  While David Stainbrook has departed DFW and Massachusetts, he has left a consequential legacy behind that deserves careful examination. We will begin to do that here.
  </p><p>
  The shortcomings of DFW's 2016 evaluation of Carlisle's forest, done under Mr. Stainbrook's supervision, have <a href="#ForestHealth">already been discussed</a> and needn't be repeated.
  </p><p>
    In 2019, Mr. Stainbrook gave a presentation on his view of the Massachusetts deer situation and how to deal with it. In this presentation, he offered the following chart:
  </p><p>
      <img src="/images/stainbrook_growth.png"}>
  </p><p>

  </p><p>
 Mr. Stainbrook gives us a range of growth rates, 4%-10%. At the 4% rate, it would take a deer herd 18 years to double in the absence of human interference. It would take 8 years at the 10% rate. Since Mr. Stainbrook's principal focus was suburban towns in eastern Massachusetts, where, as we have discussed, deer herds are well fed, his growth rate range is extraordinarily low.  Compare with
 Connecticut DEEP's 2-year time-to-double or Hale/McCarthy's 3-year time-to-double. I don't pretend to know the reason that Mr. Stainbrook's growth rates are so low; it may simply be a mistake.
 But without engaging in speculation about how this happened, it is a fact that lower growth rates make hunting appear more feasible as a deer population control method. Mr. Stainbrook did make an argument for suburban towns adopting hunting programs and
 this growth rate was part of that argument.

  </p><p>
  Unfortunately, a number of towns have accepted Mr. Stainbrook's flawed argument without question or, apparently, without consulting the deer literature, and have adopted bow-hunting programs. 
    <blockquote>
      "For all these towns [Dover, Framingham, Weston], including Carlisle, the archery hunt is not going to make any difference." -- Dr. Allen Rutberg, Director of the Center for Animals and Public Policy at Tufts University, Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine, Carlisle presentation "Resolving Suburban Deer Conflicts:  Realities and Hopes," November 21, 2019.
    </blockquote>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  We are not opposed to correcting ecological problems, especially those of our own making, 
when we can intervene in ways that satisfy good scientific and engineering criteria:
  
  <ul>
    <li>
    Problems are definitively established by qualified and unbiased people.
    </li>

    <li>
    Remedies, if needed, are selected based on the science underlying the problems and attack their root cause(s).
    </li>

    <li>
    Metrics -- the feedback that tells us whether or not our remedies are working -- are an integral part of any problem-solving program, so that we can make intelligent, data-driven corrections.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Lastly, the image below is included from the Humane Society pamphlet to remind us all that we are making life
  and death decisions
  about living creatures and that we have an obligation to them and to ourselves to get the
  analysis right before resorting to lethal means.

  [3] To replicate my result for 5 years and a growth rate of 41.4% with an HP12c (all the calculations for various time periods and growth rates for the bar chart were done with Google Sheets): first: press the yellow 'f' key and then 2, to set the display to two decimal places. Now set n=5, i=41.4, PV=513, FV=-200 (enter 200 and press CHS), select end mode, and solve for PMT. You will get -240.23 (this is the total number of deer that would have to be removed from the herd to reduce the size to 200 if all were killed after reproduction).
  Now set 'begin' mode and solve for PMT again (this is the same calculation, except with this configuration, all deer are killed before reproduction). You should get -169.90. Press '+' to add the two results, press '2' and the division button to compute their average, which should be -205.07. Now enter 56, which is the sum of 25 deer killed/year in auto collisions and 31 deer killed/year in private-land and Great Meadow hunts. Press +. If you did all this correctly, you should now have -149.07 in the display.

  </p><p>
  We can't kill fractional numbers of deer, so (the absolute value of) this result must be rounded up to 150. Why round up? Normal rounding will sometimes give us an answer that will fall slightly short of our objective. This is not an important issue.
  </p><p>
  As for ignoring the sign of the answer, I refer
  you to the HP12c manual's description of the sign conventions used in cash flow problems. While we must correctly observe those conventions when solving such problems with the calculator, we don't need to be so strict in our discussions, as long as our
  conclusions are consistent with the the math.  I believe the text is clear that when using these results, even without the minus sign, we are referring to deer removed from the herd, just as one might say "I withdrew $150 from my bank account", as opposed to "A flow of -$150 occurred in my bank account".
  </p><p  id="F4">
  [4] Consulting the bar chart, we see that 126 and 64 are the number of deer that must be killed to reduce the herd from 513 to 200 in 30 years, assuming growth rates
      of 41.4% and 26% respectively. How can the results be the same for the different problem we just solved? The answer lies in rounding error. The actual results for the two problems are not integral numbers of deer; there are digits to the right of
      the decimal point. The reduce-to-200-in-30-years problem answers are larger than those of the maintenance problem,  as you would expect, but only very slightly; the differences are to the right of the decimal point.
      Since we can't kill fractional numbers of deer, all answers must be rounded up to the nearest integer. This rounding-up hides the difference in the answers to the two problems.
